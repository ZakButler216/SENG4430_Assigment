This is a Software Quality Tool that assesses software quality for Java programs.
The software metrics it can evaluate are:
a) Cyclomatic Complexity
b) Comment Percentage
c) Fan In
d) Fan Out
e) Coupling
f) Program Size
g) Response for a Class
h) Program Size
i) Number of Children
j) Depth of Inheritance Tree
k) Length of Identifiers
l) Lack of Cohesion in Methods.

The commands to operate this software are:
new (sets a new directory);
parse (parses all compilation units from that directory);
class (sets a current class to be evaluated);
eval (evaluate software metrics based on user's choice)
view (view items)
exit (exit)

To evaluate metrics, please choose the alphabet corresponding to it.
For example: a to evaluate Cyclomatic Complexity, d to evaluate Fan Out, j to evaluate Depth of Inheritance Tree etc.
p.s. for Coupling, the program is capable of evaluating Coupling for the whole program (e*) or for itself (e).

To start the program, click run from metrics.Main, and the program will run.
