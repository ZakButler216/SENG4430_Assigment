The main File takes a java file (which is currently hard coded in for testing purposes), then creates a compilation unit, 
as well as a list of strings, each element consisting of one line of code.
Create new metric object, and pass in either compilation unit, or list of strings in constructor (whichever works best for your metric)

I set it up so when the metric object is created, all the calculations are done straight away, so the only method calls needed are to
show the results.

Any questions just ask.
