Program size is measured by the number of statements in a program.
Note: This metric (program size) is useful when comparing orders of magnitude. While it is debatable exactly how to measure
program size, discrepancies of an order of magnitude can be clear indicators of software complexity or man-hours.

Statements in all classes: 401
The number of statements in the current class is shown in the above table.
Note: These results are either good or bad depending on what the program is doing.
