Total coupling value of program: 194
Total coupling value of program per class (excluding internal classes): 21
Loosely coupled classes (excluding internal classes): 1/9 classes
Final evaluation is based on this loosely coupled ratio. A class is loosely coupled when their coupling value is less than or equal to 4.

Final Evaluation of Program: High coupling
This is a bad result. Coupling needs to be greatly reduced.
